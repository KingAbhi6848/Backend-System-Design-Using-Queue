Backend System Design Using Queue
Overview
This project is a backend system designed to handle requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each user has a dedicated queue, and their requests are processed in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. The system is built using Node.js, RabbitMQ for queue management, and PostgreSQL/MongoDB for database storage.

Features
User Authentication: Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
Request Queueing: Each user has a dedicated queue for managing requests.
Request Processing: Requests are processed sequentially by worker processes.
Concurrency Management: Support for multiple clients with independent queues.
Scalability: Ability to scale the system by adding more workers to handle increased load.
Robustness: Error handling and automatic recovery from failures.
Logging and Monitoring: Real-time logging and system metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend framework.
RabbitMQ (or Redis/Kafka): Queue management system.
PostgreSQL/MongoDB: Database for storing user data and logs.
JWT: Authentication system.
Prometheus and Grafana: Monitoring and visualization tools.

Installation
Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Backend-System-Design-Using-Queue-master
Install dependencies:
   npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory with the following contents:
   PORT = 3000
   MONGO_URI = mongodb://localhost:27017/backend
   RABBITMQ_URI = amqp://localhost:5672
Start the server:
   npm start
Routes
The following routes are implemented in the system:

1. POST /register
Description: Registers a new user.
Body:
  {
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "userpassword"
  }
Response:
  {
    "message": "User registered successfully"
  }
2. POST /login
Description: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
Body:
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "userpassword"
  }
Response:
  {
    "token": "jwt_token"
  }
3. POST /enqueue
Description: Adds a request to the user's queue. Requires authentication.
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Body:
  {
    "request": "Request data"
  }
Response:
  {
    "message": "Request enqueued successfully"
  }
4. GET /status
Description: Returns the status of the user's queue, including the number of pending requests.
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Response:
  {
    "queueStatus": "pending",
    "pendingRequests": 5
  }
Usage
User Registration: Users need to register by providing their details such as name, email, and password. This data is securely stored in the database.

User Authentication: After registration, users can authenticate by providing their credentials. A JWT token is issued upon successful authentication.

Enqueue Requests: Once authenticated, users can send requests, which will be placed into their individual queues.

Request Processing: Worker processes pull requests from each user's queue and process them sequentially.

Logging and Monitoring: The system is integrated with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system performance in real-time.

Deployment
The project can be deployed using Docker. Dockerfiles are provided for creating container images of each component (Node.js backend, RabbitMQ, and the database).

Docker Compose or Kubernetes can be used for orchestrating the containers in a production environment.

Conclusion
This backend system is designed to efficiently manage and process user requests using queues. The architecture supports scalability and robustness, ensuring a smooth user experience even under heavy loads.

Now the README includes the routes for user registration, login, enqueueing requests, and checking the queue status. Let me know if you'd like to make any further changes! Would you like me to create this file for you?
